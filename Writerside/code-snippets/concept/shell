DESCRIPTION
       ssh (SSH client) is a program for logging into a remote machine and for executing commands on a remote machine.  It is intended to provide secure encrypted communications between two untrusted hosts over  an  insecure  net‐
       work.  X11 connections, arbitrary TCP ports and Unix-domain sockets can also be forwarded over the secure channel.

       ssh  connects  and logs into the specified destination, which may be specified as either [user@]hostname or a URI of the form ssh://[user@]hostname[:port].  The user must prove their identity to the remote machine using one
       of several methods (see below).

       If a command is specified, it will be executed on the remote host instead of a login shell.  A complete command line may be specified as command, or it may have additional arguments.  If supplied, the arguments will be  ap‐
       pended to the command, separated by spaces, before it is sent to the server to be executed.

       The options are as follows:

        . . .
