        <p>
            Here some suggetions from your colleagues: 1. Take the initiative and organize a PLD yourself - you just
            need to share an online meeting link, with suggested time, date and topic and invite your peers to join 2.
            Reach out to a peer in another Cohort who already did the project, to ask them if they want to participate
            in the PLDs 3. Engage on your Discord Cohort channel (ex. #cohort19 ) by asking or answering a question, or
            sharing your knowledge or experience - Find friends before colleagues!

            <p>No stable internet access? No problem! Follow these steps:</p>
            <b>üîµ Download project materials for offline access</b>

            <p><b>üîµ Set up your local coding environment when accessing the sandbox (for windows or mac OS)</b></p>
            <p>
                You can set up a working environment using the following setup to have a similar environment (Ubuntu
                20.04) like the Sandbox on your local machine. Then you can install your favorite editor vi, vim, emacs
                on the docker or wsl and also all the libraries, programming languages you need to work on the project.
                Then you can work on the projects offline. Follow the steps highlighted in this

            <p><b>üîµ Stable Internet Access Alternatives</b></p>
            <p>
                If you lack stable internet, consider these options: - Seek places with free Wi-Fi, like bars,
                libraries, coworking spaces, or university study rooms. - Utilize mobile hotspot or tethering from your
                smartphone. - Invest in a travel Wi-Fi router for reliable internet access on the go.
            </p>
            <p><b>üîµ Collaboration Tools and Backup Solutions</b></p>
            <p>
                Work on group projects efficiently using Git for version control. Plan ahead, prioritize tasks, and back
                up your work regularly to avoid data loss during internet outages.
            </p>
            <p><b>üîµ Alternative Devices</b></p>
            <p>
                Utilize tablets or cloud services like DigitalOcean if you lack a PC and follow Youssef‚Äôs advises (on
                Discord as <i>@youssef.charif.hamidi_070222): I downloaded a working version of termux on Frandroid
                because it‚Äôs no longer available on the Play store, so I started to leverage the most power of shell
                scripting to gain time and energy (because I should mention that I type with only one finger),I also
                studied well Vim shortcuts which also have been a game changer. The problem I usually encounter is some
                technologies like MySQL server or Docker aren‚Äôt supported in termux (as far as I know) , so for now, I
                am profiting of DigitalOcean 200$ free creative on our Github Student Pack and work on a rented Ubuntu
                machine when I don‚Äôt have what I need locally on termux (reliable internet connection is a must have in
                this case)</i>
            </p>
            <p>
                Use your phone, as Abdullah Mohammed Hussain (on Discord as @abdulmohusain) suggests:
                <a href="https://termux.dev/en/">download termux</a> and connect to your web terminal using
                <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-ssh-to-connect-to-a-remote-server">ssh.</a>
