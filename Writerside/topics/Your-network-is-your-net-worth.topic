                <p>

            <def title="1. Create a professional LinkedIn profile">
                <p>To have a professional-looking LinkedIn profile, here are some important things to do:</p>

                <list>
                    <li>
                        Use a professional profile photo: Your profile photo is the first thing people see when they
                        visit your LinkedIn profile. Make sure it’s a professional headshot that reflects your industry
                        and personal brand. If you do not have a professional headshot (like most of us), simply put a
                        picture of yourself.

                            Here is an article with examples and advice
                        </a>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Craft a compelling headline: Your headline should be a brief summary of your professional
                        experience, skills, and expertise. It should make people want to learn more about you. You are
                        allowed to use ChatGPT for this.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Write a summary that showcases your strengths: Your summary should highlight your professional
                        strengths, experience, and career goals. It should be well-written and engaging, and it should
                        make people want to connect with you. You are allowed to use ChatGPT for this.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Customize your LinkedIn URL: Customizing your LinkedIn URL can make it easier for people to find
                        you and remember your profile. It also looks more professional than the default URL.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        List your work experience and education: Make sure your work experience and education are
                        up-to-date and complete. Be sure to include any relevant certifications, awards, or
                        achievements.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Use keywords: Use keywords throughout your profile to help people find you when they search for
                        specific skills or expertise.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Ask for recommendations: Recommendations from colleagues and supervisors can help to validate
                        your skills and experience. Be sure to ask for recommendations from people who know your work
                        well.
                    </li>
                </list>
                <p>
                    Overall, a professional-looking LinkedIn profile should be well-written, complete, and engaging. It
                    should showcase your strengths and expertise and make people want to connect with you.
                </p>
            </def>
            <def title="2. Connect with 10 persons">
                <p>Connect with 10 new persons (you can do more if you would like of course). It could be:</p>
                <list>
                    <li>your friends</li>
                    <li>someone from the ALX SE staff</li>
                    <li>your peers</li>
                    <li>someone from your family</li>
                </list>
                <p>
                    When you ask someone to connect with you, make sure you add a personalized message. For instance, if
                    you would like to connect with
                    <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/julienbarbier/">
                        Julien Barbier,
                    </a>
                    make sure to mention that you are one of his students
                    from ALX SE. If you would like to connect with your ALX peers, make sure to mention you are going
                    through ALX. etc.
                </p>

                <p>
                    From this day on, anytime you meet someone (online, email, offline, etc.) get into the habit of
                    connecting with them on LinedIn. Remember ALX SE permits you to meet with so many incredible people.
                    Take advantage of this. You should have at least hundreds of connections at the end of the program
                    just by adding peers you interact with.
                </p>

                <p>
                    You can also follow people on LinkedIn without connecting to them. It could be people or even
                    brands. If you don’t know where to start, you can follow
                    <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/faces-of-alx-se/">
                        Faces of ALX SE
                    </a>
