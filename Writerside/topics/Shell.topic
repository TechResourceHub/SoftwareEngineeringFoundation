	<b>Manpage</b>
	<p>
		Most of Unix systems are managed by using Shell. Just as you need to know a minimum number of words to have a
		discussion in a language, you need to know a minimum number of commands to be able to easily interact with a
		system. Unix systems all have, sometimes with slight differences, the same set of commands. While it is not too
		hard to remember commands, it might be hard to remember all of their options and how exactly to use them. The
		solution to this is the <code>man command</code>. Letâ€™s go through a part of the ssh one, as there are few
		elements to know to be able to read a man page:

	<p>Some tips:</p>
	<list>
		<li>
			The <code>NAME</code> will summarize what the command is doing. As it is usually super short, you might want
			to look at <code>DESCRIPTION</code> (bellow) if ever it does not gives clear enough information
		</li>
		<li>
			The <code>SYNOPSIS</code> will help you to understand the structure of the command
			<list>
				<li>A shell command usually have this format: <code>command options parameters</code></li>
				<li>Options inside <code>[]</code> are optional</li>
				<li>The string without <code>[]</code> are mandatory</li>
			</list>
		</li>
		<li>
			<code>ssh [-46AaCfGgKkMNnqsTtVvXxYy] [-B bind_interface] [-b bind_address] [-c cipher_spec] [-D
				[bind_address:]port]</code>
			<list>
				<li>
					<code>ssh</code> is mandatory
					<list>
						<li><code>[-46AaCfGgKkMNnqsTtVvXxYy]</code> is optional</li>
						<li>
							<code>[-B bind_interface] [-b bind_address] [-c cipher_spec] [-D
								[bind_address:]port]</code> is optional
						</li>
