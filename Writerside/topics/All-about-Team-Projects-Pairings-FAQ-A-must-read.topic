            <p>
                As Software Engineers, we will very often work in teams. These teams will often be composed of people
                from entirely different backgrounds and locales. This is why we have team projects, to get you
                comfortable with this aspect of working as a Software Engineer. There are also many advantages to
                working in a team, such as constant support and diverse perspectives.
            </p>
            <p>To make this teamwork smoother, weâ€™ve crafted this special FAQ section just for you.</p>

        <def title="Why is this FAQ so crucial?">
            <p>
                Because itâ€™s your key to navigating team projects seamlessly. Think of it as a customized toolkit,
                tailored to your success in our program. ðŸ§°
            </p>
            <b>Letâ€™s get started</b>
            <p>
                <i> What is the team pairing process in the ALX Software Engineering Program?</i>
            </p>
            <p>
                Team pairing in the ALX Software Engineering Program involves matching participants to form project
                teams. These teams work collaboratively on software engineering projects.
            </p>
            <b>How are teams formed?</b>
            <p>
                Pairing Requests: * Learners are required to find project partners. * You need to send pairing requests
                to potential partners before the project begins.
            </p>
            <p>
                Reminders: * Our mentors and staff regularly send reminders about finding project partners. * These
                reminders are designed to ensure everyone has a chance to find a partner.
            </p>
            <p>
                Automatic Pairing: * If you donâ€™t secure a partner by the projectâ€™s start date: * You will be
                automatically paired with another learner who also hasnâ€™t found a partner.
            </p>
            <p>
                This process aims to create a collaborative learning environment and ensure that no one is left without
                a partner for their project work.

            <p>Can I choose my team members?</p>
            <p>
                Yes, you can. However, if you do not find yourself a partner before the project starts, you will be
                automatically paired.
            </p>
            <b>How can I know my team members?</b>
            <p>
                You can see the names of all the learners in your team at the very top of the project page.
            </p>
            <img alt="image_23.png" border-effect="rounded" src="image_23.png"/>
            <b>How Can I Find a Partner?</b>
            <p>
                Reach out to and interact with your peers in your cohort channels. Connect with them, not just for the
                team project, but because youâ€™re here to form bonds and create a network of great African engineers.
            </p>
            <b>How can I communicate with my team members?</b>
            <p>
                You can reach out to them through whatever medium that you agree upon. But as a start, you can try
                sending them an email as well as a Slack message in the event you are automatically paired.
            </p>
            <b>What if I have conflicts with my team members?</b>
            <p>
                ALX encourages open communication and collaboration. If conflicts arise, you should address them
                constructively with your team. If issues persist, reach out to ALX technical mentors for guidance.
            </p>
            <b>Can I change team members if necessary?</b>
            <p>Yes you can!</p>
            <b>How do I make this change?</b>
            <p>Follow these steps carefully;</p>

            <p><b>What happens if a team member is not actively participating?</b></p>
            <p>You can reach out to your mentor to get paired with another partner (it is your responsibility to find
                yourself a new partner) or you can reach out to your mentor to get unpaired from your current
                partner.</p>

            <p><b>How are project topics selected for teams?</b></p>
            <p>Project topics are typically assigned by ALX program administrators based on the curriculum and learning
                objectives.</p>

            <p><b>What if I have a specific project idea or request?</b></p>
            <p>While you may have project preferences, final project assignments are determined by ALX program
                administrators to ensure a balanced learning experience.</p>

            <p><b>Can teams work remotely or in person?</b></p>
            <p>The team will decide whether to work remotely or in person; it is up to you as learners to decide
                this.</p>

            <p><b>What support does ALX provide to project teams?</b></p>
            <p>ALX offers guidance, mentorship, and resources to support project teams throughout the program.</p>

            <p><b>How long will I work with my project team?</b></p>
            <p>Team assignments typically last for the duration of the project phase, which can vary.</p>

            <p><b>How can I provide feedback on the team pairing process?</b></p>
            <p>ALX welcomes feedback from participants regarding the team pairing process, and you can provide input
                through program surveys or by reaching out to program administrators and mentors.</p>
